## Getting started

### Prerequisites
You should have following stuff on your battle station:
```
php 7.2

```

### Installing

Clone the repository, and setup your environment variables (primarily just database stuff).   
Create your database as defined in your `.env` file.

Go the the command line and run:  
- `composer install`
- `yarn` or `npm install`

### Deployment

To run your copy of the website:

`yarn dev` / `npm run dev` to build the vue.js website once.  
`yarn watch` / `npm run watch` to build the vue.js website and watch for any changes to then rebuild.
